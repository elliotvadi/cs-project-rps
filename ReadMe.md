## Rock, Paper, Scissors

<br>

<br>

The project sets out to create a version of the classic game 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' in the C# programming language.



The game is run in Microsoft Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code (With the C# extension) or any other IDE that supports C#. 

In order to do this, you will need to have the latest version of the .NET Framework installed.

Upon running the program, you will be prompted to input your name. This will ensure that the program adresses you properly. 

The program will randomly choose an opponent from a list of *human* names. This name will stick for the duration of the game.

You will be promted to choose one of three moves; rock, paper or scissor. Upon doing so, the opponent will choose their move, after which the program will decide who wins the round. 

Once either the player or the opponent has a score tally of 5, the game will end. The player will then be asked if they want to play again or if they wish to exit the program.
